# Lab Instructions

In this activity, we'll put together what we know of schemas so far and build out a schema with mocks using Apollo Server and GraphQL's schema definition language.

## Guidelines

Pick a website feature and build a schema for it. You can select your favorite website or app or choose from one of these options:

- [Twitter Feed](www.twitter.com)
- [KEXP Shows Page](https://www.kexp.org/shows)
- [Amazon Product Page](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0756GB78C?pf_rd_p=a526cdf5-1d83-4a09-853e-0767afc685eb&pf_rd_r=FEEPFQBN2D2DFHHCGMHF)
- [Netflix Show Page](https://www.netflix.com/title/80179138)
- [Kirkwood Ski Resort Lodging](https://www.kirkwood.com/plan-your-trip/stay/kirkwood-lodging.aspx)
